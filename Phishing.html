            Introduction to Phishing Scams: 
        </h3>
        <p>
        Today, we're going to talk about something that affects all of us who use the internet â€“ phishing and scams. You may have heard these terms before, but do you know what it really means? Phishing and scams are both a type of cyber-attack where attackers try to trick people into giving them sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by posing as a trustworthy source. This can happen through emails, text messages, or even fake websites. And the sad part is, these scams can be very convincing and can lead to serious consequences. That's why it's important for all of us to learn about phishing scams, how they work, and what we can do to protect ourselves. 

        Phishing and scams are related in that both involve attempting to trick individuals into giving up personal information or money. However, there are some key differences between the two. 
        
        Phishing specifically refers to a type of cybercrime where attackers use emails, text messages, or fake websites to impersonate a trustworthy entity and trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information. 
        
        Scams, on the other hand, refer to a broader category of criminal schemes that involve tricking individuals into giving up money or valuable information. While phishing is a type of scam, there are many other types of scams such as investment scams, lottery scams, and advance fee scams. 
        
        In summary, all phishing attacks are scams, but not all scams are phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are specifically focused on tricking individuals into giving up sensitive information, while scams can take many different forms and have different objectives.

        <h3>
            Types of Phishing and Scams: 
        </h3>
         <p>
            Email phishing: This is the most common type of phishing scam, where attackers send an email that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank, government agency, or a well-known company. The email typically contains a link or attachment that, when clicked, will either download malware onto the victim's computer or take them to a fake website where they are prompted to enter personal information. 

            Spear phishing: This type of phishing is a targeted attack where the attacker has specific information about the victim and uses that information to make the phishing attempt more convincing. These types of phishing emails are often more sophisticated and can be difficult to detect. 

            Smishing: This type of phishing attack uses text messages instead of emails to try to trick victims into providing personal information. The text message will often contain a link that, when clicked, takes the victim to a fake website where they are prompted to enter personal information. 

            Vishing: This type of phishing uses phone calls instead of emails or text messages. The caller will typically pose as a representative from a legitimate organization and ask the victim to provide personal information. 

            Pharming: This type of phishing is a more advanced technique where attackers use malware to redirect victims to a fake website, even if the victim enters the correct URL. In this way, the attackers can steal personal information without the victim realizing they are on a fake website. 

            Clone phishing: This type of phishing is a variation of spear-phishing. In this attack, a legitimate email that has been previously sent and received is used as a template and a malicious link or attachment is added to the email. The email is then sent to the same recipients as the original email.
